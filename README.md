# Horiseon Code Refactor

I took the company code and refactored it to optimize semantic *HTML* elements to improve *accessibility*.  Additionally, I made the *CSS* more concise and more efficient while not changing the layout or user experience.  

By doing these things, I have allowed for easier *accessibility* for users utilizing screen reader technology.

I learned that while there are many ways to achieve similar goals, some are better than others when the *accessibility* is paramount.
